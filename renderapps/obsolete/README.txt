These programs make use of the old version of the renderapi,
they need to be refactored to use both the new renderapi,
as well as the newer pattern of using a RenderModule to handle inputs and outputs
much of the code contains useful patterns, so i am keeping it here, with hopes we will move with
slowly out of this folder and into functioning code again.
